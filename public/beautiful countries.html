<h1>Most beautiful countries in the world</h1>
<h2>You should visit them once in your lifetime</h2>

<h3>India</h3>
<p>Home to Himalayan peaks and Indian Ocean beaches, India’s terrain can only be described as breathtaking.
     Kerala is easily one of the most country’s most beautiful states, with elephants and tigers, lush lagoon
      networks, and tea plantations. There are incredible stretches of sand even outside of Kerala, like Marina 
      Beach in unsung Tamil Nadu, or Chandipur Beach in Orissa, where tides recede nearly three miles out to sea.
       The Valley of Flowers National Park is spectacular, as hundred of species of alpine flowers carpet the western 
       Himalayas in chromatic glory.</p>

<h3>Brazil</h3>
<p>There is no shortage of grandeur in Brazil, whether you’re standing below the horseshoe-shaped falls of Iguazu,
     kayaking through the incomparable Amazon, or looking out from the peak of Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. Fernando
      de Noronha, an archipelago off the northeast coast, features some of the best beaches in the country. Lençóis
       Maranhenses National Park boasts blindingly white sand dunes juxtaposed against turquoise lagoons. Then there’s
        the biodiversity—the greatest on the planet, to be exact. It’s not uncommon to spot jaguars, spider monkeys,
         piranhas, giant water lilies, and mangroves (among several other million species).</p>

<h3>Colombia</h3>
<p>Colombia’s incredible landscape deserves to be recognized, and not just because it contains parts of the Amazon 
    rainforest and the Andes mountain range. Tayrona National Park is one of the most picturesque places in South America, 
    with beaches dotted with coconut palms and rainforests sitting nearly 3,000 feet above sea level. The ochre desert
     meets the aquamarine sea at Cabo de la Vela, a unique cape surrounded by rocky cliffs—it’s hard to get to, sure,
      but absolutely worth it.</p>
